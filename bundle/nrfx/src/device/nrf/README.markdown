# Generated Go files for Nordic Semiconductors devices

In this directory, Go register description files are stored that are generated
by `gen-device.py` from .svd files provided by Nordic. See the SVD files [over
here](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/tree/master/mdk).

The original files are provided under the 3-clause BSD license, see [this
post](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/b/blog/posts/introducing-nordics-new-software-licensing-schemes)
for details. As the generated files transform most of the original file, I think
they should be licensed under the same license as the original files. Generated
files will contain the license statement that is included in the original SVD
files.
